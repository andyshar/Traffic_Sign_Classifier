**Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### Step 0: Load The Data

I set the path where you put the training data, validation data and testing data.

### Step 1: Dataset Summary & Exploration

I provided a basic summary of the Data Set using Python and Numpy.
I visualized the German Traffic Signs Dataset, including plotting traffic sign images, plotting the count of each sign.

### Step 2: Design and Test a Model Architecture

I designed and implemented a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test my model on the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

### Step 3: Test a Model on New Images

I downloaded five pictures of German traffic signs from the web and used my model to predict the traffic sign type.
Finally , I output these 5 softmax probabilities for each image found on the web.
